Last week I attend to the CSH Asia 2012 conference:High Throughput Biology- Genomics & Epigenomics.

This is the first time I go to a such big conference. I also apply to be a volunteer.

On the five days conference, I saw many core-people of this field, such as BingRen, Lucy Shapiro, Sunny Xie , and a lot of young scientists.
they are creative and passionate people. What I learned from them are keep thinking, keep asking, keep working.

On next diary I will show you some interesting works on the conference.
